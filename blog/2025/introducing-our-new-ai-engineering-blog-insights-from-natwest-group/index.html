Whether you’re an AI practitioner, software engineer, data scientist, delivery manager, or simply interested in the role technology is playing to help shape the future of finance, this blog will offer insights from the teams who are driving tech change across our bank.</p> <h3>What you can expect</h3> <h4>AI in banking</h4> <p>AI is everywhere but applying it effectively in a highly regulated industry like banking requires careful design, rigorous validation, and strong governance. We’ll discuss real-world use cases — from risk modelling to AI-powered customer interactions and pricing optimisation.</p> <h4>Engineering at scale</h4> <p>Banks operate complex technology ecosystems. We’ll share insights into building and maintaining scalable, resilient, and secure systems that power millions of transactions and interactions every day. Expect articles on cloud adoption, data engineering, software architecture, and site reliability engineering.</p> <h4>Data &amp; analytics: Turning insights into action</h4> <p>From developing machine learning models to creating real-time analytics dashboards, we’ll cover how our teams transform raw data into actionable insights that help drive better decision-making.</p> <h4>Security &amp; compliance in AI and engineering</h4> <p>In financial services, innovation must go hand-in-hand with responsibility. We’ll explore best practices for building systems that are explainable, fair, and compliant with evolving regulations — ensuring trust and security at every step.</p> <h4>Careers &amp; ways of working</h4> <p>Technology is only as good as the people who build it. We’ll share stories from our engineering and AI teams, insights into how we work, our R&amp;D projects, and advice for professionals looking to build a career in AI and financial technology.</p> <h3>Why this blog?</h3> <p>We’re building this blog not just to showcase our work, but to contribute to the wider AI and engineering community. As technology leaders, we believe in transparency, collaboration, and continuous learning. Whether it’s lessons from our successes or challenges we’ve faced, we want to foster conversations that push the boundaries of what’s possible in financial technology.</p> <p><em>The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of the NatWest Group.</em></p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c265ceb07db4" width="1" height="1" alt="">&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;<a href="https://nwg.ai/introducing-our-new-ai-engineering-blog-insights-from-natwest-group-c265ceb07db4" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Introducing our new AI &amp; engineering blog: Insights from NatWest Group</a> was originally published in <a href="https://nwg.ai" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NatWest Group AI &amp; Engineering</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</p> </body></html>
